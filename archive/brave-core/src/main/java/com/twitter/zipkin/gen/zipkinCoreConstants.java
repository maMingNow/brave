   * The {@link BinaryAnnotation#value value} of "lc" is the component or namespace of a local

   * <p/>{@link BinaryAnnotation#host} adds service context needed to support queries.
   *
   * <p/>Local Component("lc") supports three key features: flagging, query by service and filtering
   * Span.name by namespace.
   *
   * <p/>While structurally the same, local spans are fundamentally different than RPC spans in how
   * they should be interpreted. For example, zipkin v1 tools center on RPC latency and service
   * graphs. Root local-spans are neither indicative of critical path RPC latency, nor have impact
   * on the shape of a service graph. By flagging with "lc", tools can special-case local spans.
   *
   * <p/>Zipkin v1 Spans are unqueryable unless they can be indexed by service name. The only path
   * to a {@link Endpoint#service_name service name} is via {@link BinaryAnnotation#host
   * host}. By logging "lc", a local span can be queried even if no other annotations are logged.
   *
   * <p/>The value of "lc" is the namespace of {@link Span#name}. For example, it might be
   * "finatra2", for a span named "bootstrap". "lc" allows you to resolves conflicts for the same
   * Span.name, for example "finatra/bootstrap" vs "finch/bootstrap". Using local component, you'd
   * search for spans named "bootstrap" where "lc=finch"
