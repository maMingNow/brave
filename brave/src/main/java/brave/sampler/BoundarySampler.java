/**
 * This sampler is appropriate for high-traffic instrumentation (ex edge web servers that each
 * receive >100K requests) who provision random trace ids, and make the sampling decision only once.
 * It defends against nodes in the cluster selecting exactly the same ids.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * <p>This uses modulo 10000 arithmetic, which allows a minimum sample rate of 0.01%. Trace id
 * collision was noticed in practice in the Twitter front-end cluster. A random salt is here to
 * defend against nodes in the same cluster sampling exactly the same subset of trace ids. The goal
 * was full 64-bit coverage of trace IDs on multi-host deployments.
 *
 * <p>Based on https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/develop/finagle-zipkin/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finagle/zipkin/thrift/Sampler.scala#L68
